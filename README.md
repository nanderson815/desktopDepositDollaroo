## Dollaroo - Desktop Deposit Application

This is the desktop companion application to Dollaroo. The application is designed to connect via USB to an off-the-shelf cash counter. The counter validates the denomination and serial number of each bill, and then ensures each bill is unique (I.E. has not been deposited before). After validation, the application generates a request for to for payment that is sent to the internal Dollaroo dashboard.
